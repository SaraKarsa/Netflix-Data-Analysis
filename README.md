## Methodology:

The goal of this project is to practice creating and interpreting different types of visualizations using real-world data. 


## NETFLIX ANALYSIS DASHBOARD:
* The User can search the movies, Tv-shows and he/she will get a rating, duration, genre, release date, added date and Description of it.
* The Dashboard will provide interactive interface of list according to the user's choice of genre.
* The Dashboard will show the total number of movies and Tv shows released each year.
* The Dashboard will top 10 genres and a pie chart of the sum up of movies and Tv-shows released each year.
* Netflix has a major presence in the United States and India. Its focus has shifted recently towards TV shows which were previously on movies. More TV shows are released than movies.

## Key Findings:

Movies Vs Tv Shows By Year: Netflix platform even has content which was originally released in 1965. For a better visual I have only displayed the  year 2019. We observe that initially, the percentage of movies is higher than TV shows. Total no. of movies 1546 and Tv Shows 803 watched by people in 2019.

Total Movies and Tv Shows By Country: United States has the most total releases ( both movies and TV shows) followed by India and the United Kingdom. The Color in the Dark refers higher count.  Total no. of movies and shows in US – 1482, India – 724 and  UK – 170.

Show-wise Ratings: Ratings are more on TV-MA and TV-14. No. of shows in TV-MA is 2027 and TV-14 is 1698.


## Conclusion:

   * Netflix uses a data lake to store its massive data. I explored and analysed the high-level data by showing usage and watch patterns in various countries by testing the underlying assumptions. The Dashboard will provide an interactive interface of list according to the User's choice of genre.
