## Methodology:

The goal of this project is to practice creating and interpreting different types of visualizations using real world data. 


## NETFLIX ANALYSIS DASHBOARD:
* The User can search the movies,Tv show and he/she will get rating, duration, genre, release date, added date and Description about it.
* The Dashboard will provide interactive interface of list according to user choice of genre.
* The Dashboard will show total number of movies and Tv shows released each year.
* The Dashboard will top 10 genre and pie chart of sum up of movies and Tv shos released each year.
* Netflix has major presence in United states and India. Its focus has shifted recently towards TV shows which was previously on movies. More TV shows released than movies.
